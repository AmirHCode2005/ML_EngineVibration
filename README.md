# ⚙ Engine Vibration Classification 

## 📘 Overview  
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to classify engine vibration states.  
It is a Binary Classification problem where the target variable indicates abnormal vibration = 1 or normal = 0.  

## 🧠 Project Highlights  
- **Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Language:** Python 🐍 
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset:** Synthetic Engine Dataset — 60 numeric features with controlled noise for machine learning experiments  
- **Data Type:** All numeric, making preprocessing and model training straightforward  

## ⚙️ Workflow  
- **Data Preprocessing** – handled noise, scaled features, and normalized data  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – examined correlations and feature distributions  
- **Model Training** – trained Logistic Regression as the final model; also evaluated other ML algorithms  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** – optimized parameters for Logistic Regression to improve stability  
- **Model Evaluation** – assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics  

## 🚧 Challenges  
- Dataset included noisy numeric features, which required careful preprocessing  
- Ensuring balanced performance across both classes without overfitting  

## 📊 Results  
- Logistic Regression achieved **80.43% test accuracy**  
- Precision and recall values indicate balanced performance on both classes  
- Model generalizes well and identifies abnormal vibration cases reliably
